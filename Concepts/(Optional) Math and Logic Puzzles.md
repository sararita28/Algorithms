<h2>Math and Logic Puzzles</h2>

<h3>Prime Numbers</h3>
<p>Every positive integer can be decomposed into a product of primes. This means that in order for a number x to divide a number y (written x\y or mod(y, x) = 0),
  all primes in x's prime factorization must be in y's prime factorization </p>
  
<h4>The Sieve of Eratosthenes</h4>
<p>The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a highly efficient way to generate a list of primes. It works by recognizing that all non-prime numbers are divisible by a prime number.</p>

<h3>Probability</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Probability of A AND B: </b>P(A and B) = P(B given A) P(A)</li>
  <li><b>Probability of A OR B: </b>P(A or B) = P(A)+P(B) - P(A and B)</li>
  <li><b>If A and B are independent (one happening tells you nothing about the other happening): </b>P(A and B) =P(A)P(B)</p>
  <li><b>If A and B are mutually exclusive (if one happens, the other cannot happen): </b>P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Worst-case shifting</h3>
<p>Many brainteasers are worst-case minimization problems, worded either in terms of minimizing an action or in doing something at most a specific number of times.</p>

---

<ul> Keep in mind: 
  <li>As long as two events have non-zero probabilities,they will never be both mutually exclusive and independent.</li>
</ul
