<h2>Object-oriented Design</h2>
<p><b>Object-oriented</b> design questions require to sketch out the classes and methods to implement technical problems or real-life objects. They give insight 
  into someone's coding style and demonstrate that you understand how to create elegant, maintainable object-oriented code.</p>
  
<h3>How to approach</h3>
  
<p>The following approach will work well for many problems:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Handle Ambiguity: </b>OOD questions are often intentionally vague in order to test whether a candidate assumes or asks clarifying questions. When given an
    OOD question, inquie <b>who</b> is going to use it and <b>how</b> they're going to use it. Depending on the question, you may even want to go through the six Ws:
  Who, what, where, when, how and why. <b>These use cases will signifiÂ­ cantly impact your design.</b></li>
  <li><b>Define the core objects. </b></li>
  <li><b>Analyze relationships: </b>between the objects (which objects are members of which other objects? Do any objects inherit from any others? Are relationships
    many-to-many or one-to-many?)</li>
  <li><b>Investigate actions: </b>consider the key actions that the objects will take and how they relate to each other.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Design Patterns</h3>

<p>There's a myriad of design patterns. A bad approach is to try to find the 'right' one for a particular problem. A better approach is to create the design that works for that particular problem. In some cases it might be an established pattern but in many cases it's not.</p>
<p>Here are 2 widely used design patterns:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Singleton Class</b>: ensures that a class has only one instance and ensures access to the instance through the application. Note that the singleton design pattern may interfere with unit testing (causing many people to dislike it).</li>
  <li><b>Factory Method</b>: offers an interface of a class, with its subclasses deciding which class to instantiate. </li>
</ul>
