Cycle sort is a comparison sorting algorithm that forces array to be factored into the number of cycles where each of them can be rotated to produce a sorted array. <br> It is theoretically optimal in the sense that it reduces the number of writes to the original array.
This approach is quite useful when dealing with numbers in a given range and asking to find the duplicates/missing ones etc.<br> 
When the problem involving arrays containing numbers in a given range, you should think about Cyclic Sort pattern.
The time complexity of cycle sort is O(n2), even in the best case.
