Cycle sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm that forces array to be factored into the number of cycles where each of them can be rotated to produce a sorted array. <br> It is theoretically optimal in terms of the total number of writes to the original array.
This approach is quite <b>useful when dealing with numbers in a given range and asking to find the duplicates/missing ones etc.</b><br> 
When the problem involving arrays containing numbers in a given range, you should think about Cyclic Sort pattern.<br> 
The time complexity of cycle sort is O(n2), even in the best case.
