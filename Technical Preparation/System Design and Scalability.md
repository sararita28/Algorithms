<h2>System Design and Scalability</h2>

<h3>Handling the questions</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Communicate:</b> A key goal of system design questions is to evaluate your ability to communicate.</li>
  <li><b>Go broad first:</b> Don't dive straight into the algorithm part or get excessively focused on one part.</li>
  <li><b>Use the whiteboard:</b> Get up to the whiteboard in the very beginning and use it to draw a picture of what you're proposing.</li>
  <li><b>Acknowledge interviewer concerns:</b> Acknowledge the issues your interviewer points out and make changes accordingly.</li>
  <li><b>Be careful about assumptions:</b> An incorrect assumption can dramatically change the problem.</li>
  <li><b>State your assumptions explicitly:</b>  When you do make assumptions, state them.</li>
  <li><b>Estimate when necessary:</b> In many cases, you might not have the data you need. You can estimate this with other data you know.</li>
  <li><b>Drive:</b> Ask questions. Be open about tradeoffs. Continue to go deeper. Continue to make improvements.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Design: Step-by-step</h3>
<ol>
  <li><b>Scope the problem</b>: you want to ensure that you're building what the interviewer wants. There are questions that must be answered before going further.</li>
  <li><b>Make reasonable assumptions</b></li>
  <li><b>Draw the major components:</b> Draw a picture of what this system might look like. Walk through your system from end-to-end to provide a flow.</li>
  <li><b>Identify the key issues</b></li>
  <li><b>Redesign for the key issues</b>: Adjust your design for the key issues. Be open about any limitations in your design.</li>
</ol>
