<h2>Trees</h2>
<img src='https://bournetocode.com/projects/AQA_A_Theory/pages/img/RootedTree.png'/>
<b>Definition:</b> A tree is an <b>undirected graph</b> which satisfies any of the following definitions: 
<ul>
  <li>An acyclic connected graph (acyclic = has no cycles, connected = there's a path between every pair of vertices).</li>
  <li>A connected graph with N nodes (including a root node and children nodes) and N-1 edges.</li>
  <li>A graph in which any two verticles are connected by exactly one path.</li>
</ul>

<p>The nodes may or may not be in a particular order, they could have any data type as values and they may or may not have links back to their parent nodes. If we have a <b>rooted tree</b> then we'll want to have a reference to the root node of our tree (Which node is selected doesn't matter because any node can root the tree). A <b>child</b> is a node that extends from another node. A <b>parent</b> is the inverse of this. A <b>leaf node</b> is a node with no children. A <b>subtree</b> is a tree entirely contained within another. </p>

<p>There are occasions when you might have a tree that is not a binary tree. For example, suppose you were using a tree to represent a bunch of phone numbers. In this case, you might use a 10-ary tree, with each node having up to 10 children (one for each digit).</p>

<h3>Types of Trees</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Tree (non-binary)</li>
  <li>Binary Tree</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Binary Search Tree</li>
        <ul>
          <li>AVL tree.</li>
          <li>Red-black trees</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Complete Binary Tree: a binary tree in which every level of the tree is fully filled, except for perhaps the last level.</li>
      <li>Full Binary Tree: a binary tree in which every node has either zero or two children.</li>
      <li>Perfect Binary Tree: a binary tree that is both full and complete.</li>
      <li>Heap (min and max)</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Balanced tree (i.e. not terribly imbalanced, or, balanced enough to ensure 0(log n) for insert and find, but not necessarily as balanced as it could be.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Red-black trees</li>
      <li>AVL trees</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Unbalanced tree</li>
  <li>Trie (a.k.a prefix tree or digital search tree or retrieval tree)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tree Traversals (preorder, inorder, postorder, level order)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Preorder:</b> visits the current node before its child nodes. prints the value of a node <b>before</b> the recursive calls. In a pre-order traversal, the root is always the first node visited.</li>
  </br>
  <li><b>In-order (most common one):</b> "visits" (often, prints) the left branch, then the current node, and finally, the right branch. Prints the value of a node <b>between</b> the recursive calls.<i> Doing so <b>on a binary search tree </b> will also print the element values in a sorted, ascending order. </i></li>
    </br>
  <li><b>Post-order:</b> visits the current node after its child nodes. prints the value of a node <b>after</b> the recursive call. In a post-order traversal, the root is always the last node visited.</li>
    </br>
  <li><b>Level order:</b> prints the value of a node <b>as it appears, one level at a time</b> (so left and right subtrees altogether). It does that by using a breadth-first search from the root to the leafs. To do so, you need to maintain a queue of the nodes left to explore.</li>
</ul>

</br>

<p>Below is a representation of different types of tree traversals <b>on a binary search tree.</b></p>

 Keep in mind: 
 <ul>
  <li>Perfect trees are rare, as they must have exactly 2k - 1 nodes (where k is the number of levels)</li>
  <li>Searching a tree is more complicated than searching a linearly organized data structure such as an array or linked list.</li>
  <li>Fluency in implementing a tree or graph from scratch will prove essential.</li>
  <li>Although a tree is actually a type of graph, trees are simpler than graphs and most people are more familiar with trees than graphs.</li>
  <li>Pre-order and other forms of tree traversal are a form of DFS.</li>
  <li>Doing an in-order tree traversal on a binary search tree will print the element values in a sorted, ascending order. </li>
  <li>In a post-order traversal, the root is always the last node visited.</li>
</ul>
