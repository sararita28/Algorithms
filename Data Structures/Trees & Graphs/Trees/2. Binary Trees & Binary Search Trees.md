<p>Among the long list of tree DS, you have <b>binary trees</b> and <b>binary search trees</b>.</p>
<p>A <b>binary tree </b>is a tree for which every node has at most 2 children. A <b>binary search tree </b>is a binary tree that satisfies the <b>BST invarient:</b> the left subtree has elements smaller or equal than the value of the current node and the right subtree has elements larger than the value of the current node. <b><i>And this would depend on if you allow for duplicate values or not (usually we're only interested in unique elements inside our tree)*</i>.</b> Some examples of BT and BST usage include but are not limited to: implementation of some map and set ADTs, red black trees, AVL trees, Splay trees, binary heaps, syntax trees, treap...</p>
<p><i>* Note: The definition of a binary search tree can vary slightly with respect to equality. Under some definitions, the tree cannot have duplicate values. In others, the duplicate values will be on the right or can be on either side. All are valid definitions.</i></p>

<h3> Balanced Binary Search Trees (BBST)</h3>
<p>A <b>balanced binary Search tree</b> is a self-balancing binary search tree. It adjusts itself in order to maintain a low (logarithmic) height allowing for faster operations such as insertions and deletions.</p>

<p align='center'><b>BBST Complexity</b></p>
<table align='center'>
  <tr>
    <td>Insert</td>
    <td>O(logn)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Delete</td>
    <td>O(logn)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Remove</td>
    <td>O(logn)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Search</td>
    <td>O(logn)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Central to how nearly all BBST keep themselves balanced is the concept of <b>tree rotations</b>.</p>
<p>The secret ingredient to most BBST algorithms is the clever use of 2 things: <b>a tree invarient</b> and <b>tree rotations</b>.</p>
<p>A tree invarient is a property/rule you impose on your tree that it must meet after every operation. To ensure that the invarient is always satisfied a series of tree rotations are normally applied. You can rotate/transform the values and nodes in a tree as you please as long as the BST invarient remaints satisfied (since BBSTs are BSTs).</p>
<p>In some BBST implementations where you need to access the parent/uncle nodes it's convenient for nodes to also have a reference to the parent nodes, but this complicates tree rotations because you would have to update a lot more pointers</p>

<ul> Keep in mind: 
  <li>Binary trees do fairly well with ordering.</li>
  <li>The definition of a binary search tree can vary slightly with respect to equality. Are duplicates allowed?</li>
</ul>
